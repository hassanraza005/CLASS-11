You are proud as a master poet,
Poetic soul with rhythmical intellect,
Verse and prose comes from you imaginative wit, <br>
Be laud with a prolific languages steal our spirit.
<br/> <br/> 
One sadden moment I read your poetry,
Deep with significant messages, got pity with my vocabulary, <br>
What a wonderful legendary poem story created beautifully.
Bravo, hooray! , , , it hooked my heart amazingly,
<br/> <br/>
A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue,
Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide,<br> no it can't be,
Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece,
Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence.
<br/> <br/>
Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out,
Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt, <br>
Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust,
Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear poet.
